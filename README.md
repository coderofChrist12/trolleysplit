# TrolleySplit

In many South Afican households and student groups, groceries are bought as a team. We also have community social clubs who also gather money so they can all have enough, however, budgeting is often messy, undocumented and unfair. This app makes it simple to  plan together, share fairly and spend smarter. TrolleySplit is a simple web app I built to make grocery shopping easier for groups. You can add items, assign members, split costs fairly, and even share your list with friends via WhatsApp. It’s meant to save time and avoid confusion when splitting bills.
